<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>This game is written in C++ using SFML library.</p>
<p>In order to compile game and run it, you need to have g++ and SFML library installed.</p>
<p>https://www.sfml-dev.org/ - link to official web-site of sfml library. You can download this lib. using this website.</p>
<p>In Makefile I hardcoded pathes to sfml lib., which installed in /usr/local/lib by default in MacOS. If you have installed sfml in different location, pathes in Makefile should be changed</p>
  
<p>PS. I have been writting this game on MacOS But SFML supports also Windows and Linux, thus game can be compiled on this platforms.</p>
